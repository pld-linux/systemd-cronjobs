systemd-cronjobs - crond replacement using systemd timers
=========================================================

The purpose of this package is to replace any crond package in PLD with much
more powerful systemd timers, while not forcing them for every PLD
installation.

The package does not aim to be backward-compatible with existing crontabs.
This could be done with some wrapper or systemd generator, but the cron jobs
would be still designed for crond and just extra overhead would be added under
systemd.

Guarding any crontab entry with /sbin/systemd_booted is an extra overhead for
non-systemd systems.

The idea is that PLD packages can provide both crontabs and systemd timers,
like they provide systemd units and init.d startup scripts. When a crond is
installed, the crontabs would be used, when the new 'systemd-cronjobs' package
is installed, then the systemd timers will be used.

systemd-cronjobs obsoletes all cron daemons, so it can be used when no crond
services are required in the system â€“ neither by any of installed packages,
nor by users.

Packaging cronjobs
------------------

A package, to be compatible both with crond and systemd-cronjobs, should
'Require: cronjobs' (instead of 'crondaemon' or 'crontabs') and provide both
a crontab and a set of two systemd units:

cronjob-%{name}.timer
cronjob-%{name}.service

The first one defines the schedule and should be WantedBy cronjobs.target (not
multi-user.target, so it is used only when crond is not installed). The other
defines how the service should be started each time the timer fires.

The usual %systemd_{post,preun,reload} macros should be used in
%post/%preun/%postun for the cronjob-%{name}.timer unit.

For packages that do not have own crontabs, but just drop a script into
/etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly} directory the only required change is
the 'Require: cronjobs' dependency.

Packaging cron daemons
----------------------

Cron daemon packages should Provide and Obsolete 'cronjobs' in addition to
'crondaemon' and 'crontabs'.
